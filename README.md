# CS-251-Project-03-Test-Cases
Simple python script to generate an 'out.txt' file with a list of random products for CS 251 Project_03. Compile and run this script to generate a text file with a random product with the specified format on each line. Changing the variable 'i' in the main for loop will generate that many products. 

If this does not compile, make sure you have all the required libraries installed. Please submit any issues and I will try to fix them ASAP :)
